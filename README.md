# Directory reader
A web page intended to display images in natural order. This was originally made in mine to read long strip, webtoon-like content which do not display well when they are not joined together.

## Goals
1. The webpage displays the uploaded content in natural order.
2. The webpage allows image scaling.
3. The webpage allows theme changes.
4. The webpage allows 'locations' to be saved.
5. The webpage allows drag-and-drop
6. The webpage allows youtube videos to be played on.

## Future Improvements
1. Allow more protection when deleting saved locations
2. Add content on the 'hidden' layer
3. Allow 'pages' to jump, rather than next to each otehr
